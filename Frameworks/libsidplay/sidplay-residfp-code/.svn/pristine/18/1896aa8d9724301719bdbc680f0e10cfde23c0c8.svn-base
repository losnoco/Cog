Libsidplayfp (and its console frontend sidplayfp) is a fork of sidplay2,
a C64 music player library which integrates the reSID SID chip emulation
into a cycle-based emulator environment, born with the aim to improve
the quality of emulating the 6581, 8580 chips and the surrounding C64
system in order to play SID music better.
