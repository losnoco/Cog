deprecated sidplay2::timebase, it always returns 1

* Added version defines

API changes:

deprecated method filter(const sid_filter_t *filter) from reSID builder
deprecated method filter(const sid_filterfp_t *filter) from reSIDfp builder

added method bias(const double dac_bias) to the reSID builder
The bias is given in millivolts, and a maximum reasonable control range is
approximately -500 to 500 (Actually from testing the value seems to be
in volts so dac_bias value should be in the range -0.5 - 0.5)

added methods filter6581Curve(const double filterCurve) which sets the filter
curve for 6581 chip filter in a range from 0.0 (light) to 1.0 (dark)
(default 0.5) and filter8580Curve(const double filterCurve) which sets the
filter frequency for 8580 chip (default 12500)

you can read a summary of changes from the original libsidplay2
at http://www.bel.fi/~alankila/c64-sw/index-cpp.html

other changes includes:
* audio output is now signed 16bit

* two resid builders (original and distortion patched)
