miniz <https://github.com/richgel999/miniz> v3.1.0 (2025-09-21)

Modifications for OpenMPT:
 *  #define MINIZ_NO_STDIO has been set because OpenMPT does not need stdio
    functionality and miniz relies on secure-CRT file i/o functions in windows
    builds which are not available on all mingw64 versions.
 *  Modifications have been marked by "// OpenMPT"
 *  No further changes have been made.
