miniz DEFLATE implementation.

2.1.0
Modifications for OpenMPT:
 *  #define MINIZ_NO_STDIO has been set because OpenMPT does not need stdio
    functionality and miniz relies on secure-CRT file i/o functions in windows
    builds which are not available on all mingw64 versions.
 *  #define MINIZ_USE_UNALIGNED_LOADS_AND_STORES 0 is used unconditionally,
    because unaligned access is undefined behaviour.
 *  Various warnings in platform detection logic using undefined macros have
    been fixed.
 *  Warning `warning: cast from 'const mz_uint8 *' (aka 'const unsigned char *')
    to 'const mz_uint32 *' (aka 'const unsigned int *') increases required
    alignment from 1 to 4 [-Wcast-align]` has been fixed.
 *  Definitions of `tdefl_compressor_alloc` and `tinfl_decompressor_alloc`
    have beeen fixed
 *  Missing #ifndef MINIZ_NO_STDIO has been added to miniz.h.
No further changes have been made.
