commit 59e9702be5bfc0061e756c7beab7dcd3d363400d (2019-02-07)

Modifications:
 *  Use of alloca has been replaced with malloc, as alloca is not in C99 and
    fails to compile.
 *  Macro redefinition of alloca with mingw-w64 has been fixed.
 *  Macro redefinition of STB_VORBIS_NO_STDIO has been fixed.
 *  The following warnings have been silenced:
    include/stb_vorbis/stb_vorbis.c:3928:32: warning: ‘hi’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
    include/stb_vorbis/stb_vorbis.c:3927:32: warning: ‘low’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
