commit 5a0bb8b1c1b1ca3f4e2485f4114c1c8ea021b781 (2021-07-12)

Modifications:
 *  <https://github.com/nothings/stb/pull/1746> has been applied.
 *  Use of alloca has been replaced with malloc, as alloca is not in C99 and
    fails to compile.
 *  Macro redefinition of alloca with mingw-w64 has been fixed.
 *  Macro redefinition of STB_VORBIS_NO_STDIO has been fixed.

For building, premake is used to generate Visual Studio project files.
