These libraries were modified from the originals.

First, they were generated by the bundled makefile, using:

```
make 64bit
```

Modifying the id and import paths was no longer necessary, as they
already use @rpath now.

As of editing, they are:

BASS		2.4.17
BASSMIDI	2.4.15.3
BASSFLAC	2.4.5.5
BASSOPUS	2.4.3
BASS_MPC	2.4.1.2
BASSWV		2.4.7.4
