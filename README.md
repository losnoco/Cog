ADDENDUM - 2013-09-30

I have forked this player to continue maintaining it for others to use, as its
original author appears to have left it by the wayside. I will try to continue
updating as I find more things that need fixing, or if I find new features to
add which seem like they would be useful to me or others.

Up to date binaries will be available at the following link:
